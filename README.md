## üöÄ Project Overview
The **Automated Water Billing System** is designed to simplify water billing and consumption monitoring using a combination of RFID technology and microcontroller-based controls. The system offers a user-friendly, automated solution for managing water usage in real-time.

## üîë Key Components

- **üîñ RFID Tags and Readers**: Each user is assigned an RFID card that holds account and balance data.
- **üß† Arduino MEGA**: Acts as the central control system, managing water flow and reading RFID data.
- **üì° NodeMCU ESP (Wi-Fi Module)**: Provides Wi-Fi connectivity, allowing users to interact with the system via a local webpage.
- **üöø Solenoid Valves**: Controls water flow based on the user's balance, opening or closing automatically.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Water Access**: Users tap their RFID card, and the system checks the available balance.
2. **Flow Control**: If the balance is sufficient, the solenoid valve opens to allow water to flow.
3. **Usage Monitoring**: The Arduino MEGA continuously monitors water consumption and updates the user‚Äôs balance.
4. **Balance Recharge**: Users can easily top-up their water balance through a locally hosted webpage using the NodeMCU's Wi-Fi connectivity.
5. **Auto Shutoff**: If the balance runs out, the system automatically shuts off the water supply.

## üåü Features

- **üìä Automated Billing**: Automatically tracks water usage and deducts from the user‚Äôs prepaid balance.
- **üíª Wi-Fi Recharging**: Easy balance recharge through a web interface accessible from any Wi-Fi-enabled device.
- **üèòÔ∏è Scalable Design**: Suitable for individual homes or larger complexes, ensuring flexibility in deployment.
- **üîã Energy Efficient**: Designed with low-power components for sustainable, long-term operation.

## üéØ Benefits

- **User-Friendly**: Simple system for users to monitor and manage their water usage.
- **Eco-Friendly**: Prevents water waste by limiting consumption based on prepaid balance.
- **Cost-Effective**: Reduces administrative overhead by automating the billing process.
